# Starbucks-Capstone-Project
Starbucks, as a marketing strategy, provides discounts or free services on its offerings to users. 
An offer can be merely an Information for a drink or an actual offer such as a Discount or Buy One Get One.
These offerings help in increasing sales and creating customer awareness of new products. 
Starbucks has a diverse user base. Hence not all offers are rolled out to each customer. 
Starbucks gives different offers to different customers based on their demographics and user profile. 
In a simple words Starbucksâ€™ offering are personalised. Business lean towards propensity model to reduce the expenditure in advertising, as model give them more specific target customer.

In this project our main task is to combine user data, offering details and transaction data to determine is their any affinity between user attributes and a offer type.

## Summary 
The project was completed in the following phases:
* Dataset Exploration:- In this process, the data provided was loaded to see how it looks like.
* Dataset Claening/Transformation:- In this phase changes were made to dataset to make it more meaningful and logical.
* Combining the three DataSet:- Once initial data explorationa and cleaning was done all dataset were combined.
* Target varible generation.
* EDA on the combined dataset:- This looked into dataset distribution and its relation with the target variable.
* Modelling and Performance Evaluation: In this step, various machine learning model(Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression and Random Forest) were tested on the given dataset and their respective performances was recorded.
